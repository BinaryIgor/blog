This is my blog about programming, software engineering, computer science and binary/digital machines in general. If you love getting to the core of things and you constantly ponder questions like:
* Why exactly does it work like that ?!
* Why this is so complicated, can we simplify it? Does it really need to be this way?
* Why do we even use this? Do we really need it, can we live without it?
* Ohh, this is how they did it. Can we do better? (having previously defined better, of course)
* Nice library/framework, but what core (more universal) concepts can we learn from it?

...and are not satisifed with easy, shallow answer you will feel at home here!

Also, if you like videos more, <a target="_blank" href="https://youtube.com/@BinaryIgor"> I run a youtube channel under the same name (Binary Igor)</a>.
