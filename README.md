# Blog

Experimental blog with self-made static site generator, analytics and other tools. Simple and powerful!

Requirements:
 * node 19+
 * Docker

Init:
```
npm install
```

Run all tests:
```
npm run test
```

Run single test file:
```
file=server npm run test:file
```

For the rest, checkout package.json and ops and scripts folders!


For now, blog is deployed to Digital Ocean app platform and the server (for analytics) is on the separate droplet.
