Hey there! 

I am Igor Roztropi≈Ñski, a programmer passionate about unraveling the mysteries of programming, software engineering, software design, computer science, networks and the inner workings of binary and digital machines. In a nutshell, I want to become the absolute best software engineer my potential allows me to be. Here, I invite you to this journey.

If you, like me, possess an insatiable curiosity and a relentless desire to dive deep and broad into the very essence of these subjects, constantly pondering questions like:
* How does it work and why exactly does it work that way?
* Can we simplify this seemingly complicated solution? What is the source of that complexity? Do we really need it?
* While it is nice to use this library/framework, what universal concepts can we extract from it?
* What alternative approaches and different solutions exist for this particular problem? What the tradeoffs are? Can we come up with something better?

...and if you also think these are all fascinating questions, but they do not matter at all, if we do not deliver results effectively and productively, then you will feel at home here!

If some of that sounds a little too vague or abstract, worry not! I have been working in the industry since 2017 and have shipped, collaborated on and maintained many production-ready and production-used systems; both at work for companies and outside it, as my own ventures and projects. I am deeply, deeply curious about answers to those questions, but ultimately, they serve us to architect and deliver software that provide value in the real world, for real people.
