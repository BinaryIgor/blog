If you possess an insatiable curiosity and a relentless desire to dive deep into the very essence of (mostly software-related) subjects, constantly pondering questions like:
* How does it work, and why exactly does it work that way?
* Can we simplify this seemingly complicated solution? What is the source of that complexity?
* Do we really need this, or can we live without it?
* Ooh, this is how they solved this problem. Can we do better?
* While it is nice to use this library/framework, what universal concepts can we extract from it?
* What alternative approaches and different solutions exist for this particular problem?

...and if you crave answers that go beyond the superficial and the obvious, then you will feel at home here!
