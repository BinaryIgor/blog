<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>    
<div class="mt-2 my-0 text-2xl text-center text-secondary-3">2025-11-11</div>

<p class="mt-2 mb-12 italic">In short: I do not do anything weird with your data. It is being processed in the absolute minimum way possible and I do my best to keep it secure.</p>

**If you subscribe to my newsletter**,  I have your email address as given by you. This address is used solely to send you messages related to this newsletter - I do not share it with any third party except as necessary to make the newsletter functionality possible. For that, there is my email platform provider - [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/); they also know your email, as they provide the infrastructure and software that allows me to manage subscriptions and send you emails. To apply spam prevention measures, they are aware of your IP address as well. Additionally, I store your email address in my own database, for analytics and redundancy purposes. As described below, my blog is hosted on the [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) infrastructure. 

You can unsubscribe from my newsletter any time by using a link provided in every newsletter issue or simply by writing to me at {{ contactEmail }}. When you unsubscribe, I do keep your data for a reasonable amount of time - typically a few weeks - in case you resubscribe. After that, it is permanently deleted. If you would like it to be removed immediately, just email me; in the exact same way, you might update your email address.

**Beyond the newsletter**, these are the things I know about you:
* **visitorId** - unique id that my script generates in the browser and stores in the local storage, on your device 
* **sessionId** - id of your current session generated and stored in the same way as *visitorId*
* **ipHash** - hash of your IP, which is a unique value generated from your IP address. Since hashing is a one-way function, it is not possible to reverse it and recover the original IP value
* **source** - source of your visit on my website such as special query parameter or most likely a domain of the website from which you have clicked

As we can see, this data does not allow me to personally identify you in any way. I use it solely for my content analytics: to see how many unique visitors and sessions my website gets, which posts and pages are the most popular, how people learn about my content (source) and so on. This data is not shared with any third party other than the fact that it is stored in my database. Both the database and blog are hosted on the [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) infrastructure.

If for any reason you do not want to have this data assigned to your session, just disable local storage in your browser; then, I will know absolutely nothing about you. But as said, these values do not allow anybody to identify you personally in any meaningful way.

I may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.

In case of any questions or doubts about your data or how it is processed, contact me at {{ contactEmail }}.
