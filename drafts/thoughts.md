Source Code is the Source of Truth: who ought to understand it?

Source code is the code written at the abstraction layer and in the language we regularly read and modify - thus must understand. It is the ultimate system specification and definition - documentation comes and goes, gets outdated frequently and more often than not skips on important details. From the source code, the system is created - it is always true, always up to date and every detail is spelled out there. Since it is the most important artifact of the system - the Definition - the art of writing code as clearly, simply and unambiguously as possible has been and will always remain of key importance.

With the programming languages, we have been steadily increasing their abstraction level, pretty much since the very inception of the software development craft. From the binary machine code to assembly, from assembly to C, and from C to high-level programming languages of today: Java, C#, JavaScript, Python and so on.

Yesterday's source code was written in machine code and assembly; today's is in one of those high-level programming languages.

As LLMs and agentic coding tools built on top of them has been learning to generate source code, some of their avid supporters began to argue: 

"We should not look at the source code any longer! Given detailed specification, LLMs can generate code according to what was fed to them; checking and reviewing the output only slows the process down. Humans are the bottleneck!"

But, if we no longer look at the source code - which is the ultimate system definition - what control, understanding and quality assurances of the system do we have? 

As long as there is software, there is the source code - the code written at the abstraction layer and in the language we regularly read and modify. One day, we might start to use even higher-level than today's popular programming languages are, resembling English more, maybe even more suitable for LLMs to work with - although I remain sceptical, since with every abstraction level raise, we lose another degree of control and ability to customize as well.

So, if writing highly detailed English prompts allows you to get desired Java, C#, JavaScript or Python system specifications more efficiently, by all means do it! But as long as this is our source code, and not English prompts for LLMs to generate something else, we are responsible for being able to read, understand, explain, modify and make sense of it all.
