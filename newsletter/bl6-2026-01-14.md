# BL#6: Performance of MariaDB & others on remote machines

### Surprising and expected at the same time results.

Welcome back guys,

As we have recently compared [MySQL vs Postgres Performance](https://binaryigor.com/mysql-vs-postgresql-performance.html), I got curious with two related questions:

1. What about MariaDB?
2. How different performance might be on remote machines, hosted on the Cloud?

So, what I have done:

* [Added MariaDB support and local test results to the repo](https://github.com/BinaryIgor/code-examples/tree/master/sql-dbs-performance/results/local) - they are quite interesting!
* Ran our 17 test cases from the article on the remote virtual machines, hosted on the DigitalOcean infrastructure. The results are in the repo, but [I have also published them on my YouTube channel, doing it live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POIC6R9OkIo).  The results were slightly different and interesting as well

See you in the next entry!
