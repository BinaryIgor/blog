# BL#2025-11-05: Concurrency and Locking

Hey,

I've just published a new blog post, discussing problems and tradeoffs related to *Optimistic and Pessimistic Locking*. Especially, what might happen if we don't lock properly; well, usually, lost data (updates), money and confused users. Not good!

Thankfully, both strategies of locking have pretty good support in most popular languages and ecosystems; there is no excuse in not using them :)

Another interesting thing I've come to realize is that we might easily emulate *Optimistic Locking* behavior with `FOR UPDATE NOWAIT` and `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` SQL clauses. 

You can read the whole post here: [https://binaryigor.com/optimistic-vs-pessimistic-locking.html](https://binaryigor.com/optimistic-vs-pessimistic-locking.html)

Hope you enjoy it and see you in the next entry!
