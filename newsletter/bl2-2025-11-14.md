# BL#2: Modularity and Data

### How various data-related issues - ownership, boundaries, consistency and synchronization - apply to Modularity and design of our systems.

Hey,

I have just published a new blog post, exploring how various data-related issues - *ownership, boundaries, consistency and synchronization* - apply to Modularity and design of our systems. It discusses how to think about the modules - folder or versioned package in a modular monolith, separately deployed microservice - from the perspective of data flow; and what are the consequences of designs (architectures) where the flow of data is not treated as a crucial design factor. Spoiler: *bad things tend to happen*!

As we have discovered in [**Modularity**](https://binaryigor.com/modularity-posts.html), it turns out that these problems - and their solutions - do not depend on whether we have one or many deployment units, single monolith or multiple services. They are universal. 

What's more, when writing this piece, I have discovered at least two more interesting dimensions of Modularity worth exploring; so stay tuned for the next posts!

As for this one, you can read it here: [https://binaryigor.com/modular-monolith-and-microservices-data.html](https://binaryigor.com/modular-monolith-and-microservices-data.html)

Hope you enjoy it and see you in the next entry!
