# BL#7: Two Scopes of Data Consistency

### Local data is immediately consistent - there are no delays, it appears either in its final form or not at all. In the global scope however, things look totally different.

Hey!

Today, we go back to the fundamental [**Modularity**](https://binaryigor.com/modularity-posts.html) topics, but with a data/state-heavy focus, delving into things like:

* local vs global data consistency scope & why true transactions are possible only in the first one
* immediate vs eventual consistency & why the first one is achievable only within local, single module/service scope
* transactions vs long-running-processes & why it is not a good idea to pursue distributed transactions - we should rather design and think about such cases as processes (long-running) instead
* Sagas, Choreography and Orchestration

Here is the deep dive: [https://binaryigor.com/data-consistency-transactions-delays-processes.html](https://binaryigor.com/data-consistency-transactions-delays-processes.html)

Hope you find it fascinating and see you in the next entry!
