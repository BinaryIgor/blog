# BL#5: MySQL vs PostgreSQL Performance

### Which database yields better performance?

Hey guys,

As you might know, I find databases fascinating; they are both so fundamental to most, if not all, systems we build - *who does not need to store and access data?* - as well as being just deeply captivating in their complexity, features and guarantees they must provide to be useful, reliable and - *performant*. Arguably, most of the computer science's data structures and algorithms live there at some level.

Some time ago, we delved deep into the [MySQL and PostgreSQL differences](https://binaryigor.com/mysql-and-postgresql-different-approaches.html) and as promised, today, we are focusing on just one angle of the Dolphin vs the Elephant comparison:

*Which database yields better performance?*

Do you have your contender? I had it too, but was deeply surprised at how big the real difference is! Without spoiling it, the results and lots, lots of details are available in the post: [https://binaryigor.com/mysql-vs-postgresql-performance.html](https://binaryigor.com/mysql-vs-postgresql-performance.html)

I wonder whether you will be as surprised as I was. In any case, I hope you find it useful and interesting - see you in the next entry!
