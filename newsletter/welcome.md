Thanks for subscribing to the Binary Log Newsletter! Here, I inform you about my latest posts as well as share additional learnings, insights and otherwise interesting and valuable things I got to know recently.

I highly value information hygiene and minimalism; expect to get pure signals from me a few times per month.

In the meantime, here are a few of my posts that might be of interest to you, as a start:

* [How many HTTP requests/second can a Single Machine handle?](https://binaryigor.com/how-many-http-requests-can-a-single-machine-handle.html)

See you in the next one!
