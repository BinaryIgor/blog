# BL#3: Modularity and Independence of work, deployments and scalability

### How modularity principles affect the possibility to have parallel work, independent deployments and organization scalability.

Hello!

I have just published a new blog post diving deep into another interesting dimension of [**Modularity**](https://binaryigor.com/modularity-posts.html) that I promised to cover. It is about the possibility and requirements for parallel work, independent deployments and organization scalability. 

Basically, the main question I wanted to have answered was:

*Are multiple deployment units (services) required to have parallel work, independent deployments and organization scalability?*

If you have read my previous posts on *the Modularity*, an answer will probably not surprise you; but there are many details and nuances as to exactly why it is the case! There are also a few edge cases and tradeoffs to analyze and make.

The post is available here: [https://binaryigor.com/modular-monolith-and-microservices-work-deployments-scalability.html](https://binaryigor.com/modular-monolith-and-microservices-work-deployments-scalability.html)

Hope you find it interesting and useful - see you in the next entry!
